# ThatFruedDued Blooket Hack

## What is this?

This is a hack for the popular online game, [Blooket](https://www.blooket.com). It is currently under heavy development. It uses an advanced unique system that loads custom modified source code for Blooket. You can find these scripts in the `scripts` folder.

## How do I use this?

Use this bookmarklet on the Blooket website:
`javascript:fetch('https://thatfrueddued.github.io/blooket-hack/index.js').then(r=>r.text()).then(t=>(new Function(t))())`

*How do I make a bookmarklet?*
Copy-paste the above code into the URL field of a bookmark in your web browser. Then, once on the Blooket page, click the bookmark.

Once you see the interface after you click the bookmarklet, toggle your desired options via the interface. Once you are done customizing, press "Launch Hack". This will open a new tab. Wait for this new tab to **completely** load (it will flash white once), then play Blooket as you would.

# Features

## Essential Patches
Adds some essential patches to the game's code to allow the script to remain executing. Keep this enabled unless you really, *really* know what you are doing.

## Spoof Admin
Make the Blooket website running on your computer think that you are an administrator of Blooket. **NOTE:** In most, if not all cases, this does not grant you any extra features due to server-side checks.

## Spoof Plus
Make the Blooket website running on your computer think that you have a Blooket Plus subscription. **NOTE:** In some cases, this does not grant you any extra features due to server-side checks.

## Unlock All Blooks
Unlock all the blooks in Blooket when you play a hosted game. **NOTE:** This does not add all blooks to your account, it just makes them available for you to choose in a live game.

## Bypass Random Name
Use a custom name, even when the host has "Use Random Names" enabled.

## Skip Box Open Animation
Skip the annoying box opening animation when opening boxes.

## Factory / Always Get Mega Bot
Always pull a Mega Bot after you answer a question correctly in Factory **if the Mega Bot has been unlocked. NOTE:** The Mega Bot is not unlocked right when the game starts. I believe you must collect a certain amount of money before it is unlocked and you can start using it, but I'm not sure what the criteria is for unlocking the Mega Bot.
